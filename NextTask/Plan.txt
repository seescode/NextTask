Plan:
*Remember to save to github!
-Switch primary key of Task from guid back to int in db and code.
-Create a new class called TaskRepository.  It should have all CRUD operations on it.  
   Create:
     -Create to TaskSet
	 -Insert into db
   Update:
     -Update to TaskSet
	 -Update db
   Delete:
     -Delete from TaskSet
	 -Delete from db
   Select:
     -Load data from db to TaskSet
-What if you created a new table called TaskSet that just contains a comma separated list of task ids.
The order of the task ids would determine the queue order.  Then persisting the queue ordering would
just be a matter of transversing through the queue and getting all ids.
